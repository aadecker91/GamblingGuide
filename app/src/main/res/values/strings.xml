    <string name="introduction">This application is made for beginners who want to educate themselves before gambling. It\'s not just about luck, by being knowledgeable about what games to play and how to play, you can minimize losses, and maybe even come out on top.\nThis application includes beginners details on some of the more popular (and most fair) casino games.  Remember that EVERYTHING in a casino is to the casino\'s advantage, smart gamblers do not play to win, they play to have fun, and if they do win it\'s a nice bonus.  For each casino game in the application, there are four sections to help you succeed, each section is gone over in detail below:</string>
    <string name="disclaimer">Disclaimer</string>
    <string name="readme_blackjack">Blackjack is the most widely played casino game in the world. Blackjack is a card game between a player and dealer, meaning that players compete against the dealer but not against any other players.</string>
    <string name="rules_blackjack">The object of the game is to beat the dealer, which can be done in a number of ways:\n\n• Get 21 points on the player\'s first two cards (called a blackjack), without a dealer blackjack;\n• Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or\n• Let the dealer draw additional cards until his or her hand exceeds 21.\n\nThe player or players are dealt an initial two-card hand and add together the value of their cards. Face cards are counted as ten points. A player and the dealer can count his or her own ace as 1 point or 11 points. All other cards are counted as the numeric value shown on the card. After receiving their initial two cards, players have several possible actions discussed later on. In a given round, the player or the dealer wins by having a score of 21 or by having the highest score that is less than 21. Scoring higher than 21 (\"busting\") results in a loss. A player may win by having any final score equal to or less than 21 if the dealer busts. If a player holds an ace valued as 11, the hand is called \"soft\", meaning that the player cannot go bust by taking an additional card; 11 plus the value of any other card will always be less than or equal to 21. Otherwise, the hand is \"hard\".\n\nThe dealer has to take hits until his or her cards total 17 or more points. (In some casinos the dealer also hits on a \"soft\" 17, e.g. an initial ace and six.) Players win if they do not bust and have a total that is higher than the dealer\'s. The dealer loses if he or she busts or has a lesser hand than the player who has not busted. If the player and dealer have the same total, this is called a \"push\" and the player typically does not win or lose money on that hand.</string>
    <string name="player_actions_blackjack">After receiving an initial two cards, the player has up to four standard options: \"hit\", \"stand\", \"double down\", or \"split\". Each option has a corresponding hand signal.\n\n• Hit: Take another card from the dealer. Signal: Tap the table with finger or wave hand toward body.\n• Stand: Take no more cards. Signal: Wave hand horizontally.\n• Double down: The player is allowed to double his initial bet in exchange for committing to stand after receiving exactly one more card. The additional bet is placed in the betting box next to the original bet. Signal: Place additional chips beside the original bet outside the betting box, and point with one finger.\n• Split: If the first two cards of a hand have the same value, the player can split them into two hands, by moving a second bet equal to the first into an area outside the betting box. The dealer separates the two cards and draws an additional card on each, placing one bet with each hand. The player then plays out the two separate hands in turn; except for a few restrictions, the hands are treated as independent new hands, with the player winning or losing their wager separately for each hand. Doubling and further splitting of post-split hands may be restricted, and blackjacks after a split are counted as non-blackjack 21 when comparing against the dealer\'s hand. Hitting split aces is usually not allowed. Signal: Place additional chips next to the original bet outside the betting box; point with two fingers spread into a V formation.</string>
    <string name="readme_craps">Craps is a dice game in which the players make wagers on the outcome of the roll, or a series of rolls, of a pair of dice.  It is often one of the liveliest tables in a casino which can often be intimidating to a new player, but don\'t worry because the optimal strategy is very simple and easy to learn.\n\nI won\'t go into detail regarding all the different bets and strategies that have to do with Craps because these things are not going to be used in the betting strategy and if you are really interested you can learn them on your own.</string>
    <string name="player_bets_craps">Pass line bet: The fundamental bet in craps is the pass line bet, which is a bet for the shooter to win.\n\n• If the come-out roll is 7 or 11, the bet wins.\n• If the come-out roll is 2, 3 or 12, the bet loses (known as "crapping out").\n• If the roll is any other value, it establishes a point.\n\t• If, with a point established, that point is rolled again before a 7, the bet wins.\n\t• If, with a point established, a 7 is rolled before the point is rolled again ("seven out"), the bet loses.\n\nThe pass line bet pays even money.\n\nPass odds: If a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 is thrown on the come-out roll (i.e., if a point is established), most casinos allow pass line players to take odds by placing up to some predetermined multiple of the pass line bet, behind the pass line. This additional bet wins if the point is rolled again before a 7 is rolled (the point is made) and pays at the true odds of 2-to-1 if 4 or 10 is the point, 3-to-2 if 5 or 9 is the point, or 6-to-5 if 6 or 8 is the point.</string>
    <string name="rules_craps">Players take turns rolling two dice and whoever is throwing the dice is called the "shooter". Players can bet on the various options by placing chips directly on the appropriately-marked sections of the layout, or asking the base dealer or stickman to do so, depending on which bet is being made. The game is played in rounds and "Pass" and "Don\'t Pass" bets are betting on the outcome of a round.\n\n  Each round has two phases: "come-out" and "point". To start a round, the shooter makes one or more "come-out" rolls. A come-out roll of 2, 3 or 12 is called "craps" or "crapping out", and anyone betting the Pass line loses. A come-out roll of 7 or 11 is a "natural", and the Pass line wins. The other possible numbers are the point numbers: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. If the shooter rolls one of these numbers on the come-out roll, this establishes the "point" - to "pass" or "win", the point number must be rolled again before a seven. The dealer flips a button to the "On" side and moves it to the point number signifying the second phase of the round. If the shooter "hits" the point value again before rolling a seven, the Pass line wins and a new round starts. If the shooter rolls any seven before repeating the point number (a "seven-out"), the Pass line loses and the dice pass clockwise to the next new shooter for the next round.</string>
    <string name="craps_betting">The following betting strategy will allow you to reduce the house edge to around 0.85%.\n\n1.  Wait until the come-out roll (when the OFF button is displayed)\n\n2.  Place your bet on the pass line\n\n3.  Wait for a point to be established (ON is displayed)\n\n4.  Take an odds bet equal to your pass line (put your bet outside of the pass line closest to you).\n\n5.  Repeat steps 1-4 for each come out roll.\n\n6.  Order a free drink and relax.\n\nNote: In many cases, you are required to put more than equal money on the odds.  This is done to make the math easier for the dealers, and they will notify you if you need to add to your odds bet.</string>
